When certain algae are stressed by a change in their environments such as a change in temperature or a change in UV light, they release Astaxanthin to defend themselves. When released, the Astaxanthin surrounds the algae and protects it, giving it the ability to survive through tough conditions. It is these protective properties that have sparked so many new studies with new human health applications constantly being discovered.<\/p>","q_detail":"<p><em>Biosphere provides a cost effective and easy way to get ideal amounts of Astaxanthin each day.<\/em><\/p>"}},"static_banner_Jn3hxH":{"type":"static-banner","blocks":{"text_dq3pMr":{"type":"text","settings":{"content":"<strong>Promote <\/strong>relaxation, <strong>reduce <\/strong>stress and <strong>normalise <\/strong>blood pressure."}},"text_UhxC3K":{"type":"text","settings":{"content":"A <strong>therapeutic <\/strong>400mg dose."}},"text_zJ849t":{"type":"text","settings":{"content":"Bioavailable 3-Magnesium blend for<strong> optimal absorption.<\/strong>"}},"text_QrT43J":{"type":"text","settings":{"content":"Produced in a world class <strong>GMP certified<\/strong> facility."}}},"block_order":["text_dq3pMr","text_UhxC3K","text_zJ849t","text_QrT43J"],"settings":{"bg_image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/01A-Header-Desktop-Landing-Page.jpg","mobile_image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/HERO_c1337951-eb7b-452f-a727-7c9bdae7b7e3.jpg","title":"Boost Your Sleep Quality WITHOUT A PRESCRIPTION","green-title":"","text-color":"","sub_title":"","rating":"five","review-label":"Trusted & Loved By 10,000+ Customers","star_count":"(500+ Reviews)","show_ratingStart":true,"button_label":"ENHANCE YOUR HEALTH NOW","button_url":"","btn-color":"#ea0606","guarantee_text":"60 DAY MONEY-BACK <strong>GUARANTEE<\/strong>","true-svg":"<svg xmlns=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2000\/svg\" width=\"429\" height=\"329\" viewbox=\"0 0 429 329\" fill=\"none\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" clip-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M158.887 211.81L370.751 0L429 58.2343L158.887 328.278L0 169.431L58.2491 111.197L158.887 211.81Z\" fill=\"rgb(0, 117, 186)\"><\/path><\/svg>"}},"icon_bar_dtkpYB":{"type":"icon-bar","blocks":{"text_image_yHD8eU":{"type":"text-image","settings":{"image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/ICONS_BAR-3.svg","title":"GMP Certified"}},"text_image_UXxKFY":{"type":"text-image","settings":{"image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/ICONS_BAR.svg","title":"Vegan"}},"text_image_D3mpxK":{"type":"text-image","settings":{"image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/ICONS_BAR-2.svg","title":"Lab Tested"}},"text_image_GxmGhN":{"type":"text-image","settings":{"image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/nothung.png","title":"100% Natural"}}},"block_order":["text_image_yHD8eU","text_image_UXxKFY","text_image_D3mpxK","text_image_GxmGhN"],"settings":{"bg_color":"#384151","font-color":"#ffffff"}},"review_bar_bBpVAy":{"type":"review-bar","blocks":{"review_6daVFL":{"type":"review","settings":{"image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/Group_1_72e16e62-4e2c-40f6-bd43-f4d67db4c47f.png","review_text":"<p>The best Magnesium supplement ever!!<br\/>I’ve tried so many Magnesium supplements before for my body cramps and insomnia.
